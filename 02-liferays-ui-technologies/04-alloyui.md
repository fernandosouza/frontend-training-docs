# AlloyUI

## What Is AlloyUI

### Key Points
- A JavaScript framework, built on top of YUI3 (project made by Yahoo!).
- Provides a large set of components. From various input controls, to complex UIs, like tree views and data tables.
- Provides a uniform API for using and creating JavaScript modules.
- Allows modular loading of JavaScript components, for scalable applications.
- Uses Bootstrap 3 (project made by Twitter) for a consistent UI look.

## AlloyUI’s Usage In Portal

### Key Points
- Included by default with Portal since version 6.0.
- Taglibs were built around AlloyUI components, to make integrations simpler for frontend and backend developers.
- The majority of Portal’s JavaScript is patterned after AlloyUI’s module pattern.

## AlloyUI’s Status Beginning With Portal 7.0

### Key Points
- Being sunsetted and deprecated, so no longer recommended.
- Continued support for EE and DXP customers, but is in maintenance mode.
- Included by default, so existing AlloyUI based code will still continue to work.
- Will still be available in future versions of Portal, to give developers time to migrate to their frontend tech-of-choice.

The direction Liferay is heading in is one in which developers have full control over the frontend libraries that are loaded onto the page. And making the individual components more reusable and modular.
