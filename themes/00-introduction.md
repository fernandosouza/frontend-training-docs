# Introduction

From a high-level, themes in 7.0 haven't changed that much since 6.2. They are plugins made up of css, templates, images and javascript that modify the look and feel of Liferay Portal.

What has changed are the tools and libraries used in developing themes. Here is what we'll cover.

- Themes Generator
- Themelets
- Lexicon
- Lexicon Customizer
- Theme Contributors
- Importing Resources

## Themes Generator

The Themes Generator is a new tool for quick and easy development of Liferay themes. It consists of a Yeoman generator for quickly templating out a new theme project, and a set of Gulp tasks for building and deploying themes.

## Themelets

Themelets are small, extendable, and reusable pieces of code that are implemented by a theme. They can consist of css, templates, images, and javascript just like a theme.

They exist as npm packages and can be published to the npm registry for easy sharing and reuse.
